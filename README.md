# Insights gained

### 1. Workforce Distribution
* **Purpose:**  This column chart shows the total headcount for each job role.
* **Visualizations & Insights:**
    * **The company's largest departments are Technology and Healthcare, with headcounts of 19,322 and 17,074 respectively. These are the company's core operational areas.
    * **Finance, Media, and Education are significantly smaller departments, indicating a different scale of operations or strategic focus.

### 2. Overall Attrition Rate
* **Purpose:** This pie chart shows the proportion of employees who have left the company ("Left") versus those who have stayed ("Stayed").
* **Visualizations & Insights:**
    * **The most critical finding is the high attrition rate of 53%. This means that for every 100 employees, 53 have left.
    * **The raw numbers confirm this: there are 39,128 leavers compared to only 35,370 stayers.
   * **This chart signals a major organizational issue, as such a high turnover rate is costly and unsustainable.

* **Visualizations & Insights:**
    * **Employees in the Technology and Healthcare sectors have the highest average monthly salaries.

   * **This chart provides an immediate overview of the company's compensation structure and shows which roles are the most lucrative.
### 4.Employee Attrition by Job Role
* **Purpose:** This clustered bar chart shows the number of employees who have left ("Left") and stayed ("Stayed") within each job role.
* **Visualizations & Insights:**
    * **The chart reveals that the Technology and Healthcare job roles have the highest number of employee departures..
    * **While all departments have leavers, these two roles stand out as the primary drivers of the overall attrition rate.
   * **This visualization helps pinpoint the specific areas of the business most affected by employee turnover.
### 5. Employee Distribution by Age Group
* **Purpose:** This doughnut chart shows the breakdown of the workforce by age.
* **Visualizations & Insights:**
    * **The majority of the company's workforce is concentrated in the 25-34 and 35-44 age groups.
    * **This indicates that the company's talent base is largely composed of mid-career professionals.
   * **It also shows that the number of employees in the "Under 25" and "55+" age brackets is significantly smaller.
### 6. Employee Distribution by Gender
* **Purpose:** This pie chart shows the gender ratio of the workforce.
* **Visualizations & Insights:**
    * **The company has a nearly equal gender distribution, with a slight majority of males.
    * **The raw numbers (33,672 males vs. 40,826 females) provide a precise count of each demographic.

### 7.  Employee Distribution by Job Satisfaction
* **Purpose:** This doughnut chart shows the distribution of employees by their level of job satisfaction.
* **Visualizations & Insights:**
    * **While "High" is a significant category, the number of employees with "Medium" or "Low" satisfaction is also considerable.
